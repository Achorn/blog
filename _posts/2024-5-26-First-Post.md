Entry 01 : Sun may 26 2024

Day one. I spent so much time thinking about when to start that I realized it was just an excuse not to start. Im still not finished with my THREEjs lesson but i know enough to create an environement to put blocks down and thats good enough as any to start.

I’ve also been playing with wood toy blocks ( that’s another blog post) and it gave me the courage to put some blocks in place as placeholders until i make some spaceship models in blender.

I added a wireframe sphere as a visual boarder.

Some random particles to simulate stars (i want this game to be less realistic and more magical so i want the stars to float around the ships)

And some blue and red blocks of different sizes to emulate a home and away team

And some controls to pinch zoom in and out of the battle field. (This will be removed for user input controls later)

No controls
Nothing that looks like a ship..

But a start

Later i will add controls and a square to fly around…

Then hopefully i will continue my search for best practices for creating classes and frameworks for this type of game.

Things im worried about

Confusing spaghetti code
Howto best add a gui for canvas and how to start stop restart pause a game.

So.. the actual game part.
