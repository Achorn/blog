Entry 01 : Sun may 26 2024

Day one. I spent so much time thinking about when to start that I realized it was just an excuse not to start. Im still not finished with my THREEjs lesson but i know enough to create an environement to put blocks down and thats good enough as any to start.

I’ve also been playing with wood toy blocks ( that’s another blog post) and it gave me the courage to put some blocks in place as placeholders until I make some spaceship models in blender.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/first-post-01/blocks.jpg)

I added a wireframe sphere as a visual boarder.

Some random particles to simulate stars (i want this game to be less realistic and more magical so i want the stars to float around the ships)
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/first-post-01/sphere.jpg)

And some blue and red blocks of different sizes to emulate a home and away team

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/first-post-01/world.jpg)

And some controls to pinch zoom in and out of the battle field. (This will be removed for user input controls later)

No controls
Nothing that looks like a ship..

But a start

Later i will add controls and a square to fly around…

Then hopefully i will continue my search for best practices for creating classes and frameworks for this type of game.

Things im worried about

Confusing spaghetti code
Howto best add a gui for canvas and how to start stop restart pause a game.

So.. the actual game part.
