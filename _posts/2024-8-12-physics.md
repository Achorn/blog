Bounce Bounce Bounce ...

After I made my V1 of the game, I was excited to add audio... and then this little voice kept whispering in the back of my head…. “Phyyysiiicssss”

Honestly, adding physics to my game is scaring me. I did a small tutorial with threejs and a physics engine but the idea of incorporating it into my game is pretty daunting. I understand it would greatly improve my collision detection with my bullets and spaceships. (And might also fix my frame rate lag) but it just feels like a lot right now.


So today I focussed on doing some research, and figuring out how to plug everything in (this tends to be the annoying part but once its all in place you hardly have to worry about it) some tutorials skip the set up part which is annoying or they just skim the setup.


## Day two

Im finding it difficult to initialize a project. Whenever I demo or start a tutorial, I get caught up with setting everything up. There are so many ways.

For example. Importing threejs is pretty simple. There’s documentation and a lot of examples online for installing it. 

Npm install three

However. Ammo js? What do you want me to do? 



## Continued…

This week has been difficult. Started a new barista job and also a freelance wed dev job at the same time. Finding time to workout and game dev has been challenging. 

Found some nice tutorials which I'll link 

Simon is enjoyable but nearly impossible to follow as a beginner because he leaves a lot of the actual building out but does a great job at explaining what is happening

This one is so easy to follow with explanations and readable comments (this guy must have been a teacher)

And an article with 3 parts where I really want to get to the second part to learn how to combine user input with a physics world. (But its clunky and hard to follow like im reading someones diary. (Lots of misspelling and clunky sentances) 

Maybe I don't need to add physics to the user controlled ship and can just add it to the bullets and unmoving ships but I want to learn more about collisions first



Damn. What a trip. Added some physics and am losing my mind with how fun it is to mess around in my game. The shooting and combat will have it's place in the future, but boy. Bouncing balls around and bouncing them off things is quite fun.


## New story line 

while messing around with the physics engine I discovered some new inspiration for some story lines. the bullets are very bouncy like ping pong balls. 


side story
You need to transfer a nest of space catipillars from one space kept Forrest to another because  it is being destroyed by businessmen. For business reasons. You collect some eggs to help heard the families to another location where it's safe for now. Your ship sucks them up and can shoot them out like bullets into a nearby Forrest. Along the way you start playing little games like pool or something.


You can shoot as many as you sucked up ‘bullet limit'. How cool. 


It’s nice to have fun every once in a while. Life is about enjoying things. This games purpose is joy. For this moment in time. This game will be other things as well. 


Shoot sticking catapillar bonbs to other ships.. 
destructive….
