Physics. 

So after i made my V1 of the game, i was excited to add audio to my game.. and then this little voice kept whispering in the back of my head…. “Phyyysiiicssss”

Honestly adding physics to my game is scaring me. I did a small tutorial with threejs and a physics engine but the idea of incorporating it into my game is pretty daunting. I understand it would greatly improve my collision detection with my bullets and spaceships. (And might also fix my frame rate lag) but it just feels like a lot right now.


So today i focussed on doing some research. And figuring out how to plug everything in (this tends to be the annoying part but once its all in place you never have to worry about it again) some tutorials skip the set up part which is annoying or go over only half of it .


Day two

Im finding it difficult to initialize a project. Whenever i demo or start a tutorial i walkways get caught up with setting everything up. There are so many ways 

For example. Importing threejs is pretty simple. There’s documentation and a lot of examples online for installing it. 

Npm install three

However. Ammo js? What do you want me to do?

This week has been difficult. Started a new barista job and also a freelance wed dev job at the same time to finding time to workout and game dev has been challenging. 

Found some nice tutorials which ill link 

Simon is enjoyable but nearly impossible to follow as a beginner because he leaves a lot of the actual building out while doing great at explaining what is happening

This one is so easy to follow with explanations and readable comments (this guy must have been a teacher)

And an article with 3 parts where i really want to get to the second part to learn how to combine user input with a physics world. (But its clunky and hard to follow like im reading someones diary. Lots of misspelling and clunky sentances) 

Maybe i dont need to add physics to the user controlled ship and can just add it to the bullets and unmoving ships but i want to learn more about collisions first



Damn. What a trip. Added some physics and am losing my mind with how fun it is to mess around in my game. The shooting part with have its place but boy. Bouncing balls around and bouncing them off things is quite fun. 


New story line 

You need to transfer a nest of space catipillars from one space kept Forrest to another because  it is being destroyed by businessmen. For business reasons. You collect some eggs to help heard the families to another location that is safe for now. Your ship sucks them up and can shoot them out like bullets into a nearby Forrest. Along the way you start playing little games like pool or something.


You  have as many as you sucked up ‘bullet limit. How cool. 


It’s nice to have fun every once in a while. Life is about enjoying things. This games purpose is joy. For this moment in time. This game will be other things as well. 


Shoot sticking catapillar bonbs to other ships.. 
destructive….


Typewriter..

Me wanting something new generates warmth. 

Helps me survive. 

The hope of the future. The hope of satisfaction helps with the now of dispare. The now of difficulty. Maybe this new obsession. This new typewriter. Will give me that feeling of satisfaction… but maybe its the hope that it will that is giving me that satisfaction. 


That hope is keeping me alive… at least thats what it feels like. A short term gratification that helps get me through the long term ones… like videogame development… its sooooo long.. this typewriter helps me during the slow months….


That you hope. You keep me going. Even in the hard times.
