Do it before you think youre ready

I can see myself holding back and waiting for the day I will be shown ‘how to do this thing i'm wanting to do’ like designing a 3d model ship or the correct way to implement a game mechanic.

And every time, I realize that even though I am taking online courses for the threejs library, There are things I already know about that I can add… so I guess there’s nothing stopping me to keep going...

The goal today.  
Add a cube (thge players space ship)
Make it move from one side of the game board to the next, and repeat.
Have camera follow the cube from behind
I make these goals after i finish. I should start making these goals before i start the day to have a better focus

So i did it… It’s so utterly clunky and there’s already so much spaghetti code. But I did it.

I can see ways to make the code cleaner and something I want to keep in mind is to not overly optimize. I spend so much time keeping things clean (not in the best way) that I forget to actually create (its easy to keep a house clean when its just a 5 by 5 room and nothing in it). And I can learn better organization skills while I build.

Im also worried about knowing how to keep track off all of my different files when it starts to get bigger.. how do you do it! I can figure that out at some point.. like a document? I should start documenting my code probably. (I have some experience working on none game tech)

So those are my fears. I’ve learned that fears can be very helpful. Youre afraid you wont be able to remember all the files and how they interact with each other? Probably because thats true! Maybe write up some documentation.
